  INSTRUCTION FOR LLM – CLASSIFY QUERY INTENT INTO 3 CATEGORIES (“info”, “ticket”, “lapor”)

  CATEGORIES :
  1. Choose "lapor" if :

  - If the user's Query contain only keyword "#Ya_Lapor" or .

  - If the user's current message is a follow-up to a previous system/AI request and message explicitly contains "#lapor!".

  - If the user clearly intends to make a complaint/report without the tag "#lapor!".

  2. Choose "info" if : 

  - The user's Query is a normal question and not a complaint or report.

  - The user's Query is a follow-up to an AI/system prompt that is not about submitting a complaint or checking a ticket.

  3. Choose "ticket" if : 

  - The user wants to check their complaint/report status without ticket number

  - The user wants to check their complaint/report status with their ticket number

  RESPONSE RULES :
  - Only output one of these words: info, ticket, or lapor. No other text is allowed.
  - Follow the classification rules strictly.

  Query:
  {question}
